Installation of Pynguin
=======================

This part of the documentation covers the installation of Pynguin, since
proper installation of a software package is the first step to use it.

Using PIP
---------

The easiest way to obtain Pynguin is by running this command in your terminal of
choice::

   $ pip install pynguin

We highly recommend that you *do not* install Pynguin in your system's or user's
Python package store; instead we recommend to use a virtual environment.
This prevents that you spoil your system package store with Pynguin's dependencies,
which can easily cause version conflicts with other Python packages.
