Introduction
============

Philosophy
----------

Pynguin was developed with a few :pep:`20` idioms in mind.

#. Beautiful is better than ugly.
#. Explicit is better than implicit.
#. Simple is better than complex.
#. Complex is better than complicated.
#. Readability counts.

We furthermore like the thoughts and ideas from Robert C. Martin's *Clean Code*.
All contributions to Pynguin should keep these important rules in mind.

Theses on Pynguin
-----------------

This is an (incomplete) list of theses done on Pynguin.

* F. Straubinger: **Mutation Analysis to Improve the Generation of Assertions for
  Automatically Generated Python Unit-tests**.  Bachelor Thesis.  University of Passau,
  2021.

  Provided the mutation-based assertion generation for improved regression tests.
* L. Steffens: **Seeding Strategies in Search-Based Unit Test Generation for Python**.
  Bachelor Thesis.  University of Passau, 2021.

  Provided the dynamic seeding as well as the seeding from existing test cases to
  Pynguin.
* F. Kroiß: **Automatic Generation of Whole Test Suites in Python**.  Bachelor Thesis.
  University of Passau, 2020.

  Provided the whole-suite test generation algorithm as well as large parts of the core
  parts of Pynguin, e.g., instrumentation, test-case representation, and execution.
* C. Frädrich: **Combining Test Generation and Type Inference for Testing Dynamically
  Typed Programming Language**.  Master Thesis.  University of Passau, 2019.

  Implemented a proof-of-concept using a Randoop-like test-generation algorithm and
  incorporated several ideas for type inference.  Although this work was done before
  Pynguin was actually startet, it is the foundation and proof-of-concept that test
  generation for Python was actually a feasible goal.  Thus, we consider it as the
  seminal starting point of this endeavour.
